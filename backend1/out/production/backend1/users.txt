i want to create database tables for my math online system, the system will require pupils to register through providing the following details username firstname lastname emailAddress date_of_birth school_registration_number image_file.png which all need to be stored, the system also has school representative that also have details. the systems also has schools whose details should include the name, district, school registration number, email of representative and name of representative.
the system also has an administrator that uploads questions and answers into the system for the pupils to attempt. The system will have challenges forexample like three challenges each comprising of random 10 questions picked from the question uploaded by the administrator, each challenge is to have a validity range for a specified time. only valid challenges can be attempted,the questions attempted in each challenge should have a time frame of lets say 10 minutes.
In that system a pupils can view challenges before choosing to attempt any.
the school representative also confirms applicants through righting commands of confirm yes/no {username}, those confirmed yes are stored in a database table called participants, those confirmed no are stored in a database table called rejected. An email notification is sent for all cases. If one tries to register again under the same school after being rejected, they are informed on the command line interface and denied from registering under the school.

The web system also gives analytics including, The most correctly answered questions, School Rankings, Performance of schools and participants over the years and time, Percentage repetition of questions for a given participant across attempts(use a formula of your own choice), List of worst performing schools for a given challenge, List of best performing schools for all challenges, List of participants with incomplete challenges, Other reports, which may add value to the project
